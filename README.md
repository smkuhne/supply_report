# Supply Report

An application that helps users figure out which supermarkets have the items they need and where there are less people.

## Inspiration
Leaving the home to obtain supplies is a basic human necessity. However, trekking out to a store location only to find it out of stock poses a serious issue. The more time spent out of isolation, the more at-risk you are of contracting a viral infection. We sought to build something which could expedite the process of looking for necessary supplies and reduce possible outside exposure during the current COVID19 pandemic.

## What it does
Our application allows the user to view supermarkets, department stores, and other places of interest which sell vital supplies. Users can report on the availability of store items to alert others of shortages at locations nearest them. They can then plan their supply runs accordingly, removing the uncertainty of whether a store has a necessary item in stock.

## How we built it
We used a large combination of different technologies. The data is stored in a Cloud SQL instance which is accessed directly by an app engine. This provides us with the ability to interact with the stored data via API calls. The front-end was made using Flutter, a cross-platform mobile application framework.

## Challenges we ran into
Putting everything together was definitely the hardest part of the development process. We got the server, SQL instance, and application to work on their own, but having them communicate with one another was a bit more difficult. Since all of us communicated with one another exclusively via text and voice call, we found it more difficult than usual to troubleshoot our final build compared to at a regular hackathon event.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The application does exactly what we set out to do and we were able to finish it despite having to learn a lot of new things along the way. We worked well together as a team despite the obvious restrictions of not being able to meet up in-person.

## What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in full stack development and the utilization of APIs in the client-server software paradigm.

## What's next for Supply Report
Going forward, we wish to add additional features and then publish our application. Since it is community driven, it would be best if a sizable community adopted our app into their daily lives.
